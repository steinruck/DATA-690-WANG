        "## The Requirements:\n",
        "- You should program and test the solution in Jupyter notebook:\n",
        "- Save/upload the notebook file to your GitHub repository\n",
        "- Submit the link of your GitHub repo to BB.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Hints:\n",
        "- You can use Python standard library random to generate one random number at a time\n",
        "- Alternatively you can use NumPy random library to generate 10 numbers at a time or 100 random number altogether in one shot.\n",
        "- You are likely to use nested loop - a loop within in another loop since you are dealing with a 10 x 10 matrix.\n",
        "- You will use modular operator (%) to determine if an integer is an odd number or an even number.\n",
        "- Use the \"end=\" option of the print() function to avoid a new line after the print and also to add additional spaces.\n",
        "for example, print(9, end=\" \") will print 9 followed by three spaces and not starting a new line.\n",
        "- Think through the logic. Try simple things first. Don't make it too complicated. You only need a few lines of code."
