        "- As a network analyst, one of my tasks is to analyze network traffic in order to determine what is happening in the network. We track access vectors and types of traffic as well as parsing through authentication logs and network connections. Surprisingly, my office does not have a data scientist. As such, we waste a lot of time copying and pasting data into spreadsheets instead of using data cleansing, visualization, descriptive statistics, or any other form of analysis that could be vastly helpful. One of the things we like to track is how many failed login attempts have happened on a device as well as successful ones. This helps us know who is trying to access something they don't have authorization to access and potential access vectors. "
